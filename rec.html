        	<p>Healthy eating is an important part of managing your type 2 diabetes. You may not always have to follow a special menu, but you should try to make smart decisions about what you eat.</p>
        	<ul><li>Should eat a balance of fruits, vegetables, lean meats (like poultry and fish), and beans for protein</li><li>Balance the number of calories you eat with your activity level</li><li>Choose foods rich in whole grains, vegetables, and fruits</li><li>Limit your intake of saturated fats, cholesterol, salt, and added sugar</li><li>Typically diabetics should consume starchy foods that contain complex sugars</li><li>Complex sugars are harder to break down and therefore provide the body with a source of sugar over a longer period of time.</li><li>Diabetes makes you more likely to get heart disease. So limiting fat, especially saturated fat and artificial Tran’s fats, is key.</li></ul>
        	<p>Counting Carbs is an important job of a diabetic by counting the amount of carbohydrates in each food a diabetic is able to parallel there insulin take with the amount of Carbs and thus allowing them to eat a wider range of foods. This is important because it allows for a more regular life to be lived.</p>
